The Cigar rawhide sofa features a sturdy corner-blocked wooden frame and raw seams for that Malboro-person look. This brown leather sofa is cozy in a cottage, cabin, or a condo. And the leather (the leather!) becomes more beautiful with use: subtle character markings such as insect bites, healed scars, and grain variation reflects a real vintage. Saddle up and pass the remote.","brand":"Jason Bourne","currentInventory":13,"id":"57a45719-59e8-4d0a-9a6c-6c33b48d2c9e"}}}

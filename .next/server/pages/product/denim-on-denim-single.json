The Cigar rawhide sofa features a sturdy corner-blocked wooden frame and raw seams for that Malboro-person look. This brown leather sofa is cozy in a cottage, cabin, or a condo. And the leather (the leather!) becomes more beautiful with use: subtle character markings such as insect bites, healed scars, and grain variation reflects a real vintage.
